HOW TO COMPILE NETHACK FOR WINDOWS WITH FMOD IN VISUAL STUDIO

0. Clone NetHack 3.7 from https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack

1. Go to https://www.fmod.com/download#fmodengine and install the latest Windows version


2. Go to the install location, and copy the core folder to Nethack/lib/
	EXAMPLE DIR: C:\Program Files (x86)\FMOD SoundSystem\FMOD Studio API Windows\api\core
	
	
3. In Visual Studio, right click the NetHackW solution, click properties, and do the following:

	I.		Go to C/C++>General>Additional Include Directories, 
	add the path to the FMOD inc folder (*lib\fmod\api\core\inc)
	
	II.		Go to C/C++>Preprocessor>Preprocessor Definitions, 
	change 'SND_LIB_WINDSOUND' to 'SND_LIB_FMOD'
	
	III.	Go to Linker>General>Additional Library Directories, 
	add the path to the FMOD lib folder (*lib\fmod\api\core\lib\<target-CPU>)
	
	IV.		Go to Linker>Input>Additional Dependencies, add 'fmod_vc.lib' to the list
	
	
Note: If you want this to work for the terminal window version, you need to repeat the above steps for the NetHack solution.
